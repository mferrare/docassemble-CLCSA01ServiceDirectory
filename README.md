The Legal Services Directory app is an easy-to-use tool designed to help users connect with legal services in their area.
Developed by students at Flinders University and updated by the Digital Law Lab, the app asks users a series of questions
about their legal needs, location, and other relevant information, and then provides a list of recommended services.

This app is a useful resource for anyone seeking legal assistance in South Australia.
